# Parallel-Bank-Transactions
Operative Systems course project

* Multiprocessing, multithreading and pipes.

* The purpose of this project was to create a conceptual banking system that ran multiple processes threads. Pipes were introduced later in the project to facilitate the comunication between the several bash terminals that were writting commands and the main terminal that was executing the commands and replying the output.
